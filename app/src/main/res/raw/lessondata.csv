Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science that help organize, manage, and store data in an efficient and compact manner. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.## There are several types of data structures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of algorithms.#;null;#An array is a type of basic data structure that can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. The elements are stored sequentially in memory, and each element can be accessed directly using its index. Arrays are useful when you want to store multiple items of the same type, and you know the size of the list in advance.##Here are some key concepts related to arrays:##- Memory Allocation: When an array is created, memory is allocated for it immediately. The size of the array (the maximum number of elements it can hold) and the type of elements are defined at the time of creation.##- Indexing: Each element in the array can be accessed using an index, starting from zero. This index refers to the location where the value is store.##- Homogeneous Data Structure: Arrays are classified as homogeneous data structures because they store elements of the same type. Once you define the type of values that your array will store, all its elements must be of that same type.##- Efficiency: Arrays provide fast access to elements and are commonly used for efficient data storage and manipulation. This efficiency comes from their grid-like structure, which allows for quick calculation of the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.#;null;#Different data structures support different operations. Some common ones are:##Push: This operation is used to add an element to the data structure. For example, in a stack or queue, the push operation adds an element to the top.##Pop: This operation is used to remove an element from the data structure. In a stack, the pop operation removes an element from the top.##IsEmpty: This operation checks if the data structure is empty. It returns true if the data structure is empty, and false otherwise.##GetSize: This operation returns the number of elements in the data structure.##Remember, the operations that a data structure supports will depend on the type of data structure. For example, arrays do not support push and pop operations, but stacks and queues do.;null;...
A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. This feature can be likened to a stack of plates, where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed.#;stack;The Push operation adds a new element at the top of the stack. The Pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.## If the stack is full, then it is said to be in an Overflow condition. conversely, if the stack is empty is said to be in an Underflow condition. Pop and Push operations need to check if the stack is empty/full to avoid Underflow/Overflow conditions.## Finally, The Peek operation returns the topmost element of the stack but does not delete it.#;null;#In computer science, stacks are used in many algorithms and data manipulation processes. They are especially useful when managing function calls in recursive programming, or for backtracking, as the process of inserting and removing from the stack automatically reverses the order of elements.#;null;#Array based stacks also have their limitations. The size of the stack is restricted, it can store only a limited amount of data. It can also lead to memory waste, if the stack size is large and only a few elements are stored, the remaining empty space is stored in memory. We’ll look at alternative approaches to combat this in future lessons.#
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. It is a collection of elements that supports two primary operations, enqueue and dequeue.#;null;#In a queue, data access is sequential. The enqueue operation adds an element to the rear of the queue, and the dequeue operation removes an element from the front. This ensures that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.## An arbitrary element in a queue can only be accessed by continuously shifting the front element.#;null;#In a queue data structure, the head and tail pointers are used to keep track of the start and end of the queue.## The head pointer always points to the first element in the queue, this is the next element that will be removed from the queue when a dequeue operation is performed.## The tail pointer always points to the position where the new element will be added (or enqueued) in the queue.## When a new element is enqueued or dequeued, the head or tail pointer moves to the next position.#;null;#Queues are beneficial in a variety of applications including Task Scheduling, Message Buffering, Network Protocols, Printer Queues, and any other situation where data elements should be processed in the order they were received.#
A circular queue is a variant of the regular queue data structure. In a regular queue, we add elements to the end (tail) and remove elements from the front (head). Once the queue becomes full, we cannot add more elements, even if there is empty space at the front of the queue due to previous dequeue operations.#;null;#A circular queue overcomes this limitation by connecting the end of the queue back to the beginning, forming a circular structure.## This means that when the tail pointer reaches the end of the queue, the next position to add an element is the beginning of the queue, if space is not currently occupied. This allows for efficient use of memory as it can utilize any free spaces left by dequeued elements.## Adding an element to a full queue (circular or standard) will still result in an overflow condition.#;null;#The circular queue offers the advantage of being more memory efficient, however this comes at the expense of added complexity.#;null;#Circular queues are popularly used in CPU Scheduling, Computer Memory Management and Traffic Control Systems.#
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two fields: the data field and the next field. The data field stores the data, and the next field stores the address of the next node in the list.#;null;#Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.## Instead, each node is stored in a separate memory location that is allocated when the node is created. This allows for dynamic memory allocation, meaning that the memory for the linked list can be allocated or deallocated at runtime. This is one of the key advantages of linked lists over arrays, as arrays require a fixed amount of memory that must be specified at the time of array creation.#;null;#An ordered list is a list in which the sequence or order of the items is important. Ordered lists are commonly used in scenarios where the order of items carries meaning, such as a step-by-step recipe, a priority queue where elements have different importance, or a leaderboard where positions represent ranks.## Adding or removing elements in the middle of a linked list involves changing the next pointers of the nodes.#;null;#Adding an Element: To add an element in the middle, we first create a new node and set its data field. We then change the next pointer of the node preceding the insertion point to point to the new node3. Finally, we set the next pointer of the new node to the node that originally followed the preceding node.## Removing an Element: To remove an element from the middle, we change the next pointer of the node preceding the one to be removed to point to the node following the one to be removed. The node to be removed is then no longer linked to the list, effectively removing it.#
When choosing a data structure, you should consider the following factors:## Understand Your Data: The type of data you’re dealing with can influence the choice of data structure. For instance, arrays might be the best choice when you need to access elements randomly from your data. Linked lists can be particularly useful when you constantly need to add or delete elements from a list, and the list size also might change.## Consider the Operations to Be Performed on the Data: Different data structures optimize different actions, such as sorting, searching, insertion, and deletion. For example, linked lists are better for actions like insertion and deletion, but binary trees are best for searching and sorting.## Evaluate the Environment: The environment in which the application will run affects how well and how promptly accessible data structures are. Consider factors like processing power, concurrency, and network latency.#;null;#In controlled access data structures like stacks and queues, the choice between arrays and linked lists depends on specific requirements. If memory is a concern and the maximum size is known, arrays could be a better choice. If the size can change dynamically, linked lists would be more suitable.#;null;#Arrays vs Linked Lists#;null;#Insertion and deletion of elements in an array can be computationally expensive as elements need to be shifted. Linked lists allow for efficient Insertions and deletions as they only require changing some pointers.## Arrays are memory-efficient when compared to linked lists as they do not require extra space for pointers.## The size of the array is fixed and needs to be known at the time of array creation whilst linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow and shrink as needed.## Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and faster access to any element at a specific index. Elements in a linked list cannot be accessed randomly, accessing elements requires traversing the list from the head node.#
Linear search is one of the simplest searching algorithms, and it works on unsorted and sorted arrays (or lists). The idea is to start from the first element and compare the desired element with every element in the list until a match is found or the whole list has been checked.#;null;#Steps:##1. Start from the first element of the list.##2. Compare the current element with the target value.##3. If the current element matches the target value, stop and return the current position.##4. If the current element does not match the target value, move to the next element.##5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you find a match or until you’ve checked all elements.##;null;#linear search is not the most efficient search algorithm, especially if the list is large. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), meaning it could potentially make n comparisons in the worst case, where n is the length of the list. In the best case (element is at the first position) the complexity is O(1).#;null;#when should you use linear search?## For small lists, linear search can be faster than more complex algorithms due to its simplicity.## When the list is unsorted and cannot be sorted. Linear search does not require the list to be sorted, unlike binary search or other efficient search algorithms.## When you don’t know if the list is sorted. Linear search works on both sorted and unsorted lists.## When memory space is limited, as linear search does not require any extra space.#
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. ##It compares the target value to the middle element of the array, if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful or the remaining half is empty.#;null;#Steps:##1. Start with the middle element of the list.##2. If the target value is equal to the middle element, return the index.##3. If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the process with the left half of the list.##4. If the target value is greater than the middle element, repeat the process with the right half of the list.##5.Repeat the steps until the target value is found or the list is exhausted.#;null;#Binary Search is used when you need to find the position of an element in a sorted list or array. ##It’s a very efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it a good choice when dealing with large data sets. However, it’s important to note that Binary Search requires the list or array to be sorted. If the data is not sorted, you would need to sort it before using Binary Search, which could add to the overall time complexity.#;null;...
Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed.#;null;#How Bubble Sort Works##1. Compare the first and second elements in the list. If the first element is larger than the second, swap them.##2. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third). Repeat the comparison and swap them if necessary.##3. Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements in the list.##4. Once you’ve gone through all the pairs, the largest element should have ‘bubbled up’ to its correct position at the end of the list.##5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all the elements except the last one. Continue the process, each time excluding the last element in the current subset.##6. Continue the process until no more swaps are needed.#;null;#The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) in both average and worst-case scenarios, where n is the number of items being sorted. This makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally it performs worse than other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Insertion Sort.#;null;#Despite its inefficiency, Bubble Sort has some use cases:##Small Lists: For small lists, especially if nearly sorted, Bubble Sort can be efficient.##Memory Constraints: Bubble Sort is in-place, meaning it doesn’t require any additional memory apart from what is used to store the list. This can make it a good choice when memory space is severely limited.#
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as Merge Sort. However, Insertion Sort provides some advantages such as it’s simple implementation and its low memory footprint.#;null;#The idea behind Insertion Sort is to divide the list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. At the beginning of the algorithm, the sorted part consists of just the first element, and the unsorted part consists of the rest of the list.##As the algorithm progresses, the sorted part grows, and the unsorted part shrinks until the entire list is sorted. This is done by repeatedly taking the first element of the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.#;null;#Steps##1. Assume the first element of the list is a single-element sorted list.##2. Insert the second element into the ‘sorted list’ to form a sorted list of two elements.##3. Insert the third element into the ‘sorted list’ to form a sorted list of three elements.##4. Repeat this process, inserting the nth element into the already ‘sorted list’ of n-1 elements.#;null;#Despite its inefficiency, Insertion Sort is an excellent choice for situations where you need to sort a list in real-time or where the list is being populated dynamically, as it can sort a list as it receives it.#
Selection Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm. The main idea behind Selection Sort is dividing the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part is the entire list.##The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right until the entire array is sorted.#;null;#Steps##1. Start by finding the minimum value in the list. Swap it with the value in the first position.##2. Find the minimum value in the rest of the list (excluding the first element) and swap it with the value in the second position.##3. Find the minimum value in the rest of the list (excluding the first two elements) and swap it with the value in the third position.##4. Repeat this process until the entire list is sorted.#;null;#The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n^2) in all cases (best, average, and worst), where n is the number of items being sorted. This makes it inefficient on large lists. However, Selection Sort has the property of minimizing the number of swaps. In applications where the cost of swapping items is high, selection sort very well may be the algorithm of choice.#;null;#While Selection Sort and Insertion Sort are both simple, comparison-based sorting algorithms, they are not exactly reverse processes of each other. Insertion Sort builds the sorted list by inserting elements into their correct position, whilst Selection Sort builds the sorted list by selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swapping it into the correct position.#
Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. The key process in the Merge Sort algorithm is the merging process.#;null;#The first part of Merge Sort involves recursively dividing the list into halves.## If the list has only one element, it is already sorted. If it has more than one element, we divide the list into two halves and recursively apply Merge Sort to each half. ##This division process continues until we have broken down the list into individual elements. Since a list with one element is always sorted, we now have “sorted” lists that we can merge together.#;null;#The second part of Merge Sort involves merging these sorted lists (initially of one element each) back together. This is done in a way that maintains the sorted order.## This merge process is applied from the bottom up. We start by merging lists of one element each to form sorted lists of two elements each. Then, we merge these sorted lists of two elements each to form sorted lists of four elements each. This process continues until we have one sorted list.#;null;#The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst), where n is the number of items being sorted. This makes it very efficient on large lists. However, Merge Sort requires space, as much as O(n), for the merge operation, so it’s not as space-efficient as other sorts.#
